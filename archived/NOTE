Most of these codes are for pitch shifting algorithms from:

Petkov, Petko N., and W. Bastiaan Kleijn. "Improving the Phase Vocoder Approach to Pitch-Shifting." INTERSPEECH 2007: 8TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION, VOLS 1-4. 2007.

This algorithm is essentially for the excitation part of single-pitch sounds after source-filter decomposition is performed. 

Derived classes:

1. class PitchShifterKTH : public PitchShifter // only this code is refactored, not yet compiled
- Iteratively subtract window spectrum from speech spectrum
- (added by myself) assume known pitch -> known number of delta functions

2. class PitchShifterKTH2 : public PitchShifterKTH // fixed from 1
- Iteratively subtract window spectrum from speech spectrum
- use an energy threshold to tell when to stop
- Derive shifted window spectrum by complex multiplication of peak bin and window spectrum

3. class PitchShifterVCO : public PitchShifterKTH // extended from 1
- Iteratively subtract window spectrum from speech spectrum
- (added by myself) assume known pitch -> known number of delta functions
- Use voice cutoff frequency (VCO)

On the other hand, the class PitchShifterPL applies the phase locking technique originally used in time stretching into pitch shifting. The outcome is not satisfying though.
